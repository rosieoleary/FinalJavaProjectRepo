In this stage, a Boat object was created. A boat has attributes of name, country of origin 
and size(in standard boatsize). An interface, "Vehicles" was implemented so that methods of
getSpeed(), accelerate() and decelerate() were inherited. getSpeed() returned the speed. 
accelerate() increases the speed by one and returns a new speed. decelerate() decreases the
speed by one and returns the new speed.
