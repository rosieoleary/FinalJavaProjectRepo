In this stage, some data is read in through a file reading method and creates objects. The 
method created, works well in creating objects of Marinas and Boats. However the method 
breaks once the array reaches "Adele". Multiple approaches have been used to try and get 
around this problem but the final approach is the least specific with the best result from 
the format. It would work perfectly if every person put through the method had a first and 
second name.

In the class, ReadInInformation.java, there are 3 methods that are needed to create the 
objects. The file is read in, the array is created and the array objects are assigned to 
create objects. To create the objects with a file of the same test format, the only function 
that is needed is createMarinaObjects("inputFile.txt").
